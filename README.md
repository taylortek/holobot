# Holobot
A simple discord bot that sends a random post from a subreddit.

# Setup

1. You're going to need to make a discord bot with the discord application page.

2. Copy the bot token (dont share this with anybody).

3. Make a new file in the "holobot" folder, name it ".env" (with no sufix such as .txt).

4. In this file you're going to put "HOLO_BOT_TOKEN=your token"

5. Now just invite your bot to your server and you're done!

# Commands
The only command right now is "r/" followed by the desired subreddit name.
